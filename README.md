# Age Detector
## Final degree project

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Final degree project, age detector in images and videos, with preprocessing based on DeepUAge.

## Steps to follow

- Clone this repository and download the necessary libraries
- Download a database with which to work
- Change the path to the database and csv
- Run the preprocessing file
- Execute the file to create_csv
- Finally you can run the model

## Some of the libraries used

- [numpy] - to create large multidimensional matrices and vectors, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on them.
- [cv2] - bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.
- [tensorflow] - open source library for machine learning across a range of tasks
- [dlib] - toolkit for making real world machine learning and data analysis applications in C++. 
- [math] - provides access to the mathematical functions defined by the C standard.
